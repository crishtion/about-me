                    <p>In this modern day of technology, it feels as if life is getting dimmer, with greedy media corporations only after profit while leaving consumers
                         extremely dissatisfied. It’s no secret that the quality of most media platforms have started to decline. I believe that there’s multiple factors 
                         that have caused this downfall, but some of the

                    <p>I grew up in the age of technology, the video game industry and the technologies behind it were rapidly advancing and I got to grow right along with it.
                        Some of my earliest memories are playing games with my brothers and being in awe at the mechanics that were implemented. As I grew older my fascination
                        with games changed into something deeper.  I started to understand that there was another layer to what I was experiencing when we played video games.
                        A level of abstraction that hid away everything that was happening in the background that led to all these memories that I had been making. I wanted
                        to understand it so badly, to know what caused everything to happen. This fascination in me never wavered, and as I grew older the interest grew with me. 
                        As soon as I started high school I enrolled into a computer science class. I instantly fell in love, and I knew that my curiosity had led me to the right
                        place. It was new and unfamiliar, a completely new language, but that challenge enticed me. I find it like a puzzle every time I'm coding, having to put
                        all the right pieces together in order to create a product I'm proud of. I love when I'm creating something and going through the process of fixing code
                        that doesn't work. Because when I can finally get the code working, that feeling is unmatched. It’s a mix of relief and excitement seeing my creations and 
                        imagination come to life. Even now as I continue my journey of learning the wonders of computer science,
                         I look forward to meeting those challenges and eventually understanding how this puzzle that is coding works.

                    <p>When I look back at my life and . My time playing tennis is probably the thing I'm most proud of. I started my tennis career under the pretense that
                        the sport would be easy and a quick way to earn a scholarship. Nothing could have prepared me for how wrong I was. I was awful at the sport and 
                        embarrassingly enough my seventh grade year, my first year ever competing, I would lose the first round at almost every tournament I played in. 
                        It wasn't until our district meet that I would win a match. In fact, I went even further than I ever had and placed second. 
                        Later that year, the COVID pandemic started and I wouldn't return to school after spring break. My eighth grade year my school's tennis team was put 
                        on hold and we wouldn't be able to compete the entire year.
