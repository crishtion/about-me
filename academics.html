                    <p>I grew up in the age of technology, the video game industry and the technologies behind it were rapidly advancing and I got to grow right along with it.
                        Some of my earliest memories are playing games with my brothers and being in awe at the mechanics that were implemented. As I grew older my fascination
                        with games changed into something deeper.  I started to understand that there was another layer to what I was experiencing when we played video games.
                        A level of abstraction that hid away everything that was happening in the background that led to all these memories that I had been making. I wanted
                        to understand it so badly, to know what caused everything to happen. This fascination in me never wavered, and as I grew older the interest grew with me. 
                        As soon as I started high school I enrolled into a computer science class. I instantly fell in love, and I knew that my curiosity had led me to the right
                        place. It was new and unfamiliar, a completely new language, but that challenge enticed me. I find it like a puzzle every time I'm coding, having to put
                        all the right pieces together in order to create a product I'm proud of. I love when I'm creating something and going through the process of fixing code
                        that doesn't work. Because when I can finally get the code working, that feeling is unmatched. Itâ€™s a mix of relief and excitement seeing my creations and 
                        imagination come to life. Even now as I continue my journey of learning the wonders of computer science,
                         I look forward to meeting those challenges and eventually understanding how this puzzle that is coding works.
