                <label for="first">The Decline of the Media Industry and the Rise of Corporate Greed (essay of choice) <span>&#x3e;</span></label>

                    <p>In this modern day of technology, it feels as if life is getting dimmer, with greedy media corporations only after profit while leaving consumers extremely dissatisfied. It’s no secret that the quality of most media has started to decline. I believe that there are multiple factors that have caused this downfall, but some of the greatest factors are the lack of passion and rising greed in studios and the development and implementation of new possibly harmful technologies.<br><br>
Firstly, I believe that one major reason the quality of the media industry has fallen, is because most media corporations put out their products purely for the sake of profit lacking passion. I feel that the market that has experienced this the most is the video game. The gaming industry has always been the topic of controversies and disregarded as a serious profession. As a result, people who did pursue this career had a sense of obligation to create games that could be enjoyed and taken seriously. In other words, people who worked at and ran studios were there because they were passionate about creating innovative mechanics, telling new stories and overall putting out quality releases. But as the industry grew and more revenue started to come in, larger corporations would buy out little studios just to treat them as a means to an end and put out games purely as cash grabs, completely throwing quality into the wind. Companies have stopped trying to innovate the industry. Rather opting to make formulaic games that revolve around microtransactions and cosmetics, that lack any real content despite pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into these projects. Some might argue that these poor products are results of time restraints and how expensive it is to make a game. I would like to mention that in recent years, time and again smaller game studios have performed and produced much more enjoyable content at a much cheaper production and sale price, than the AAA and AAAA studios.<br><br>
Furthermore, I feel that another reason the quality of the media industry has decreased is because of the experimentation and implementation of AI. With how rapidly AI has advanced there's lots of negatives that come with it. AI has proven that it can replace artists in all fields, some of the most concerning being with music and digital art. There are many AI models out there that can recreate human vocals, startlingly good. This use of AI has already made its way into mainstream music with rapper Kanye West making use of AI in his track “SKY CITY”. This was poorly received by many critics and his fan base, noting that it was very poorly implemented, creating distortions. AI has also made its way into the movie industry with studios looking for a way to save money. A24, a well respected and popular entertainment company recently faced backlash for the use of AI in their film “Late Night With the Devil”. While some might say that the use of I was minimal in the film and caused no harm to employees. I argue that AI has the potential to lead to another event similar to that of how automated machines replaced millions of employees in the automotive industry for the sake of increased productivity and decreased expense to upkeep. The truth is AI cant create art with emotion, the continued use of AI in media only contributes to the lack of passion.<br><br>
In summary, the media industry is plagued with innumerable problems. Most of which stem from the overbearing greed and new technologies such as AI. These issues have caused the downfall of many forms of media and left us in a “dark age” as consumers, where most products are poorly received and underwhelming. If these issues are not addressed and the corporations that create them are not checked, we can not expect to ever see an improvement in all forms of media.

                    <p>I grew up in the age of technology, the video game industry and the technologies behind it were rapidly advancing and I got to grow right along with it.
                        Some of my earliest memories are playing games with my brothers and being in awe at the mechanics that were implemented. As I grew older my fascination
                        with games changed into something deeper.  I started to understand that there was another layer to what I was experiencing when we played video games.
                        A level of abstraction that hid away everything that was happening in the background that led to all these memories that I had been making. I wanted
                        to understand it so badly, to know what caused everything to happen. This fascination in me never wavered, and as I grew older the interest grew with me. 
                        As soon as I started high school I enrolled into a computer science class. I instantly fell in love, and I knew that my curiosity had led me to the right
                        place. It was new and unfamiliar, a completely new language, but that challenge enticed me. I find it like a puzzle every time I'm coding, having to put
                        all the right pieces together in order to create a product I'm proud of. I love when I'm creating something and going through the process of fixing code
                        that doesn't work. Because when I can finally get the code working, that feeling is unmatched. It’s a mix of relief and excitement seeing my creations and 
                        imagination come to life. Even now as I continue my journey of learning the wonders of computer science,
                         I look forward to meeting those challenges and eventually understanding how this puzzle that is coding works.

                    <p>My time playing tennis is probably the thing I'm most proud of. I started my tennis career under the pretense that the sport
                       would be easy and a quick way to earn a scholarship. Unfortunately, I was awful and scarcely won matches. My freshman year I 
                       was put on the varsity team, my freshman year was also one full of losses.  Every tournament I played in I was put up against
                       junior or seniors or just people had many more years of experience over me. It was crushing, I had felt so out of place, like 
                       I was wasting my time. Unfortunately I was not the only other person feeling this way. By the end of my freshman year, almost 
                       everyone who was in my grade had left the team, leaving only me and another kid on the team. My sophomore year had not gone any
                       better. I lost the first round at almost every tournament I had played in. Thoughts of quitting all together started creeping into
                       my mind. Everything would change my junior year. My time playing tennis came to a climax at my team's first meeting against out 
                       rivals at a home game during team season. We had been undefeated that season, but our opponents came to put up a fight. After hours 
                       of play all the courts had cleared. the only players left were me and my opponent. This match would determine everything. The energy
                       on the court was incredibly tense. I was so exhausted, chills ran through my body and I felt incredibly dizzy. I was down on game point.
                       But with my team behind my back I was able to fight and claw my way back winning the match, and ultimately securing our team a district
                       champion title. That is a memory I will never forget.
