                    <p>In this modern day of technology, it feels as if life is getting dimmer, with greedy media corporations only after profit while leaving consumers
                         extremely dissatisfied. It’s no secret that the quality of most media platforms have started to decline. I believe that there’s multiple factors 
                         that have caused this downfall, but some of the

                    <p>I grew up in the age of technology, the video game industry and the technologies behind it were rapidly advancing and I got to grow right along with it.
                        Some of my earliest memories are playing games with my brothers and being in awe at the mechanics that were implemented. As I grew older my fascination
                        with games changed into something deeper.  I started to understand that there was another layer to what I was experiencing when we played video games.
                        A level of abstraction that hid away everything that was happening in the background that led to all these memories that I had been making. I wanted
                        to understand it so badly, to know what caused everything to happen. This fascination in me never wavered, and as I grew older the interest grew with me. 
                        As soon as I started high school I enrolled into a computer science class. I instantly fell in love, and I knew that my curiosity had led me to the right
                        place. It was new and unfamiliar, a completely new language, but that challenge enticed me. I find it like a puzzle every time I'm coding, having to put
                        all the right pieces together in order to create a product I'm proud of. I love when I'm creating something and going through the process of fixing code
                        that doesn't work. Because when I can finally get the code working, that feeling is unmatched. It’s a mix of relief and excitement seeing my creations and 
                        imagination come to life. Even now as I continue my journey of learning the wonders of computer science,
                         I look forward to meeting those challenges and eventually understanding how this puzzle that is coding works.

                    <p>My time playing tennis is probably the thing I'm most proud of. I started my tennis career under the pretense that the sport
                       would be easy and a quick way to earn a scholarship. Unfortunately, I was awful and scarcely won matches. My freshman year I 
                       was put on the varsity team, my freshman year was also one full of losses.  Every tournament I played in I was put up against
                       junior or seniors or just people had many more years of experience over me. It was crushing, I had felt so out of place, like 
                       I was wasting my time. Unfortunately I was not the only other person feeling this way. By the end of my freshman year, almost 
                       everyone who was in my grade had left the team, leaving only me and another kid on the team. My sophomore year had not gone any
                       better. I lost the first round at almost every tournament I had played in. Thoughts of quitting all together started creeping into
                       my mind. Everything would change my junior year. My time playing tennis came to a climax at my team's first meeting against out 
                       rivals at a home game during team season. We had been undefeated that season, but our opponents came to put up a fight. After hours 
                       of play all the courts had cleared. the only players left were me and my opponent. This match would determine everything. The energy
                       on the court was incredibly tense. I was so exhausted, chills ran through my body and I felt incredibly dizzy. I was down on game point.
                       But with my team behind my back I was able to fight and claw my way back winning the match, and ultimately securing our team a district
                       champion title. That
