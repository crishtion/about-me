                Running
                    <ul>
                       I am an avid runner, and often like to compete in any local runs that are going 
                    on. I love to push my body to its limits and see how much im capable of. I've completed
                     a <i>Spartan</i> Trifecta(earned by completing a 5k, 10k and half marathon), which is 
                     one of my proudest achievements. I also hope to one day complete a marathon.

                Music
                    <ul>
                        Besides trumpet, which I play for my schools band, I enjoy playing other instruments, 
                        such as piano, guitar, and trombone. I also enjoy experimenting with a little bit of 
                        musical composition and have made a few small pieces just to enjoy.
                    </ul>

                Film making & Acting
                    <ul>
                         I have directed a few films for both school and personal projects, and have even starred in a few for some of my classmates. 
                         It is a fairly new hobby of mine, and I have found it to be a fun, creative outlet. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crishtionreyna/videos" class="alert" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>
                         as well where I upload my films

            <li>
                Coding and game making
                    <ul>I also like to spend my free time learning how to code. 
                    I use many websites like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/CrishtionReyna" class="alert" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/p/immanewb" class="alert" target="_blank">tryhackme</a>,
