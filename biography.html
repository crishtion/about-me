                Running
                    <ul>
                       I am an avid runner, and often like to compete in any local runs that are going 
                    on. I hope to one day complete a marathon

                Music
                    <ul>
                        Besides trumpet, which I play for band, I enjoy playing many other instruments.
                        Such as piano, guitar, and trumbone. I also enjoy experimenting with a little bit of musical 
                        composition and have made a few small pieces just to enjoy.

                Film making & Acting
                    <ul>
                        I have directed a few films for both school & personal projects. I have even 
                        acted in a few for classmates. I find it to be a very fun creative outlet and
                        a new hobby and even have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crishtionreyna/videos" class="alert"> youtube channel</a>
                        that i upload my films too.
