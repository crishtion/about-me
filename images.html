        <p class="text">I thought it would be a cool idea to show the work 
        put in to this website and all that went on behind the scenes. So below
        images will be shown that show all the coding for each page youve viewed.</p>

          To the right you can see all the code that was used to make the home page that you interacted with 
          not to long ago. I provided comments on the code to show you what each section of code does. I used my
          knowledge of javascript, a scripting language to make the buttons on screen interactive and actually 
          move you to a new page. This was obviously the first page that I worked on and since its start its gone through many changes.
          When I first started it it was incredibly empty.
